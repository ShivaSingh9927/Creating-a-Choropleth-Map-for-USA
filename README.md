# Creating-a-Choropleth-Map-for-USA
A choropleth map is a type of thematic map that represents data by using different shades or patterns to indicate variations in a specific geographic region.
The main purpose of a choropleth map is to display spatial patterns and highlight geographical variations of a particular variable or attribute across a map. It is commonly used to represent population densities, economic indicators, election results, weather patterns, or any other data that can be linked to specific geographic locations.
